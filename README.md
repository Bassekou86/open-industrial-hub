# open-industrial-hub

**Open Industrial Hub** is an open-source platform designed to collect, normalize, and visualize industrial production data using modern web technologies.

The goal is to provide a simple, vendor-independent foundation for industrial digitalization and Industry 4.0 projects.

🚧 Project under active development – MVP in progress.

---

## Problem

In many industrial environments, production data is:
- fragmented across heterogeneous systems,
- locked in proprietary solutions,
- difficult to access and exploit with modern tools.

This makes digital transformation complex, costly, and often inaccessible to small and medium-sized companies.

---

## Objective

The objective of **open-industrial-hub** is to:
- collect industrial data (machines, production, alarms),
- normalize it into a common data model,
- expose it through a modern web API,
- visualize it in a simple real-time dashboard,
- enable basic automation and performance analysis.

---

## Scope (MVP)

The initial MVP focuses on:
- simulated industrial machines (RUN / STOP / FAULT),
- production counters and cycle times,
- data historization,
- REST API access,
- real-time dashboard visualization,
- basic industrial KPIs (availability / OEE concepts).

---

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Node.js
- Frontend: React or Vue.js
- Database: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for development)
- Real-time: WebSocket
- Version control: GitHub

---

## Project Philosophy

- Open-source and vendor-independent
- Simple, modular, and extensible
- Industry-oriented, not IoT gadget-focused
- Designed for real industrial use cases

---

## Roadmap (high level)

- [ ] Industrial data simulator
- [ ] Core data model
- [ ] REST API
- [ ] Real-time dashboard
- [ ] Basic KPIs
- [ ] Documentation and examples

---

## Status

This project is currently in early development.
Contributions, feedback, and ideas will be welcome once the MVP is stable.
